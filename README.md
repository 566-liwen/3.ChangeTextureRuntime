# 3.ChangeTextureRuntime
This project demonstrates how to change textures at runtime. The shader can accpt multiple textures as its property.

With this project, we have:
1. Pass in single value into a shader as a property (in this case, we have an integer).
2. Pass in multiple textures into a shader.
3. Switch textures at runtime.
4. Blanding different textures together (see commanded out code section).
5. Work with top down projection - world postion x and z.

Results as shown below:
